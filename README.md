### Interactive Image Blocks. Setting the element's background image gotten from the URL

This repository contains a simple interactive web page that allows user to set custom images as backgrounds for different blocks. Each block serves as a customizable container where user can input image URLs, and the JavaScript functionality dynamically sets the background of the corresponding block.

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/it-tinyangel/JS-core-DOM-the-addEventListener-Event-Object-handleEvent-MouseEvent-Interactive-Image-Blocks.git
```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Usage

1. You'll see three interactive blocks on the page. Click on any block, and a prompt will ask you to enter the image URL for that specific block.
3. If you provide a valid image URL, the block's background will be set to the chosen image.
4. If you don't enter a URL or cancel the prompt, an alert will notify you to try again.

### Customization

This code can serve as a starting point for experimenting with event-based styles or other projects based on this simple interactive image block concept.
